example data set simulated according to example 2 in Schaarschmidt et al. (submitted)

120 specimens (una,mbiguously distinguished by the variable sampleID)

technical replications invlove 3 days, 6 plates within each day
the combination of the variables day and plate provides a unique ID variable of the technical 'plate'
variable sampletype distinguishes negative controls ('NC'), unspiked biological specimens ('untreated'), spiked biological specimens ('treated'), and positive controls

normalize: log-transform and substract mean
model structure: days crossed with biological samples (ignoring plate effect within day)
