example5 - spiked and unspiked samples, illustrating CCP estimation

ID: 40 biological samples
run: 6 replications (not representing 96 well plates)
each ID is present in each run, with 2 unspiked and 2 spiked observations.

sampleType: distinguishes negative controls ('NC'), 'spiked' and 'unspiked' biological samples
model structure: ID crossed with run

- 12 responders
- 28 nonresponders

for CCP estimation: choose sampleType=unspiked in the normalization / SCP part
and sampleType = spiked in the CCP part
