Simulated data according to a data set published by Kubiak et al. (2013)

50 biological specimens, variable ID unambiguously identifies these specimens

each specimen analysed on each of 4 plates

data are already normalized

model structure: runs crossed with biological samples

Data are simulated such that summary statistics and relevant estimates are close to those that could be obtained by fittingb the data set published by 

Kubiak, R.J., Zhang, L.J., Zhang, J.C., Zhu, Y., Lee, N., Weichold, F.F., Yang, H., Abraham, V., Akufongwe, P.F., Hewitt, L., Robinson, S., Liu, W.Y., Liu, X., Patnaik, M.M., Spitz, S., Wu, Y.L., and Roskos, L.K., 2013.
