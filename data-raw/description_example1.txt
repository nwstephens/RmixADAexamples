example1 - very few responders

40 biological samples (distinguished in variable subjectID) are analyzed at each of 3 days and on each of 3 plates per day
variable treatment distinguishes negative controls ('negcontrol') from biological samples ('sample')
there are 4 obs. of a negative control within each plate 

normalize: log-transform and substract mean
model structure: runs crossed with biological samples.
when running a model with many parameters (random effects and residual variance different between subgroups), a simple model with 1 component is better than a 2-component mixture
when running a mixture model with random effects and residual variance assumed equal in both subgroups, a 2-component mixture is better than a simple model with 1 component

irrespective of the model choice, the same 2 individuals are classified as responders in the 2-component mixture
