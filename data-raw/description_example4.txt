example4 - spiked and unspiked: illustrating CCP estimation

ID: unique identifcator of 40 individual biological samples
run: Unique ID of 6 technical runs (i.e., NOT representing 96 well plates)
for each ID there are 2 unspiked and 2 spiked replications at each run

sampleType: distinguishes negative controls ('NC'), 'spiked' and 'unspiked' observations

Note: variable ID has exactly the same values for spiked and unspiked observations obtained from the same biological sample

normalization: log-transform
model structure: ID crossed with run

irrespective of different choices of variance components: 18 responders, 22 non-responders

after log-transformation: no deviatuion from normality in the non-responder subgroup

for CCP estimation: choose sampleType=unspiked in the normalization / SCP part
and sampleType = spiked in the CCP part
