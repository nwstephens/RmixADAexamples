Description: Simulated example data sets for trying mixADA. This repository contains 5 data sets in csv format, that are SIMULATED, assuming lognormal distributions. The values in, and structures of the data as well as any potential conclusions or parameter estimates do not correspond to any real experiment. The purpose of the data sets is merely to illustrate possible (or inadequate) data structures and possible application of the mixADA user interface. Further it contains 2 data sets in csv format, that are SIMULATED assuming lognormal distributions in order to resemble two real data sets w.r.t. (1) experimental design, and (2) summary statistics and relevant sample estimates. However, resulting summary statistics and estimates are not exactly the same as if using the two original data sets.
